Clipper Change Log
============================================================

v4.2.6 - 1 May 2011
* Bugfix: minor bug in SlopesEqual function.
* Update: Merging of output polygons sharing common edges 
  has been significantly inproved

v4.2.4 - 26 April 2011
Input polygon coordinates can now contain the full range of 
signed 64bit integers (ie +/-9,223,372,036,854,775,807). This 
means that floating point values can be converted to and from 
Clipper's 64bit integer coordinates structure (IntPoint) and  
still retain a precision of up to 18 decimal places. However, 
since the large-integer math that supports this expanded range 
imposes a small cost on performance (~15%), a new property 
UseFullCoordinateRange has been added to the Clipper class to 
allow users the choice of whether or not to use this expanded 
coordinate range. If this property is disabled, coordinate values 
are restricted to +/-1,500,000,000.

v4.2 - 12 April 2011
JoinCommonEdges() code significantly improved plus other minor 
improvements.

v4.1.2 - 9 April 2011
* Update: Minor code tidy. 
* Bugfix: Possible endless loop in JoinCommonEdges() in clipper.pas.

v4.1.1 - 8 April 2011
* Update: All polygon coordinates are now stored as 64bit integers
  (though they're still restricted to range -1.5e9 to +1.5e9 pending 
  the inclusion of code supporting 64bit math).
* Change: AddPolygon and AddPolygons methods now return boolean 
  values. 
* Bugfix: Bug in JoinCommonEdges() caused potential endless loop. 
* Bugfix: Bug in IsClockwise(). (C++ code only)

v4.0 - 5 April 2011
* Clipper 4 is a major rewrite of earlier versions. The biggest 
  change is that floating point values are no longer used, 
  except for the storing of edge slope values. The main benefit 
  of this is the issue of numerical robustness has been 
  addressed. Due to other major code improvements Clipper v4 
  is approximately 40% faster than Clipper v3. 
* The AddPolyPolygon method has been renamed to AddPolygons. 
* The IgnoreOrientation property has been removed. 
* The clipper_misc library has been merged back into the 
  main clipper library.
  
v3.1.0 - 17 February 2011
* Bugfix: Obscure bug in TClipperBase.SetDx method that caused 
  problems with very small edges ( edges <1/1000th pixel in size).
  
v3.0.3 - 9 February 2011
* Bugfix: Significant bug, but only in C# code.
* Update: Minor refactoring.

v3.0 - 31 January 2011
* Update: Major rewrite of the portion of code that calculates 
  the output polygons' orientation.
* Update: Help file significantly improved.
* Change: Renamed ForceOrientation property to IgnoreOrientation. 
  If the orientation of output polygons is not important, or can 
  be managed separately, clipping routines can be sped up by about 
  60% by setting IgnoreOrientation to true. Defaults to false.
* Change: The OffsetPolygon and Area functions have been moved to 
  the new unit - clipper_misc. 

2.99 - 15 January 2011
* Bugfix: Obscure bug in AddPolygon method could cause an endless loop. 

2.8 - 20 November 2010
* Updated: Output polygons which previously shared a common 
  edge are now merged. 
* Changed: The orientation of outer polygons is now clockwise 
  when the display's Y axis is positive downwards (as is 
  typical for most Windows applications). Inner polygons 
  (holes) have the opposite orientation.
* Added: Support module for Cairo Graphics Library (with demo). 
* Updated: C# and C++ demos.

2.522 - 15 October 2010
* Added C# translation (thanks to Olivier Lejeune) and 
  a link to Ruby bindings (thanks to Mike Owens).

2.0 - 30 July 2010
* Clipper now clips using both the Even-Odd (alternate) and 
  Non-Zero (winding) polygon filling rules. (Previously Clipper 
  assumed the Even-Odd rule for polygon filling.)
  
1.4c - 16 June 2010
* Added C++ support for AGG graphics library 
  
1.2s - 2 June 2010
* Added C++ translation of clipper.pas

1.0 - 9 May 2010
